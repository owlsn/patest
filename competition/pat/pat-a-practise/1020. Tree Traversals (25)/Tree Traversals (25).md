#### Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers. Given the postorder and inorder traversal sequences, you are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree.

### Input Specification:

#### Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree. The second line gives the postorder sequence and the third line gives the inorder sequence. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

#### For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.
