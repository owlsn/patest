#### Given a non-empty tree with root R, and with weight Wi assigned to each tree node Ti. The weight of a path from R to L is defined to be the sum of the weights of all the nodes along the path from R to any leaf node L.

#### Now given any weighted tree, you are supposed to find all the paths with their weights equal to a given number. For example, let's consider the tree showed in Figure 1: for each node, the upper number is the node ID which is a two-digit number, and the lower number is the weight of that node. Suppose that the given number is 24, then there exists 4 different paths which have the same given weight: {10 5 2 7}, {10 4 10}, {10 3 3 6 2} and {10 3 3 6 2}, which correspond to the red edges in Figure 1.

### Input Specification:

#### Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0 < N <= 100, the number of nodes in a tree, M (< N), the number of non-leaf nodes, and 0 < S < 230, the given weight number. The next line contains N positive numbers where Wi (<1000) corresponds to the tree node Ti. Then M lines follow, each in the format:

#### ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
#### where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 00.

### Output Specification:

#### For each test case, print all the paths with weight S in non-increasing order. Each path occupies a line with printed weights from the root to the leaf in order. All the numbers must be separated by a space with no extra space at the end of the line.

#### Note: sequence {A1, A2, ..., An} is said to be greater than sequence {B1, B2, ..., Bm} if there exists 1 <= k < min{n, m} such that Ai = Bi for i=1, ... k, and Ak+1 > Bk+1.
